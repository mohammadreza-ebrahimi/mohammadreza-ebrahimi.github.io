   <h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
 <p>Machine learning came in order to programming getting more easier that before. Actualy, in machine learning you help computer algorithm to improve through data, after that it does not need to being programmed to do so. These data are called **Trainig data** since by using them, you train an algorithm to do something special, it can be a prediction, calssification or make a decision. let me give an example. Assume you want to develop a program so that it determines that the email which you received, is _spam_ or _not spam_. If you use the old technics, it is required to update it frequently. Because for example, you give the program a keyword like _money_ to say detect it as _spam_, but if they change it to `$`, it would be incapable to detect it. But what machine learning do instead?
In machine learning, you give the computer a data set consists of so many samples of spam email. By these samples, you train the machine what a spam email looks like?</p>
