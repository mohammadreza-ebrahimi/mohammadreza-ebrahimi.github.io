### Experimental Particle Physics  

- **CERN**  
The based method of particle physics labs is acceleration. By accelerating particles to close to the speed of light, the particles collide and then the fundamental 
particle will be detected. That's not such easy, but it is the whole story. More precisely, The instruments used at CERN are purpose-built particle accelerators and 
detectors. Accelerators boost beams of particles to high energies before the beams are made to collide with each other or with stationary targets.
Detectors observe and record the results of these collisions. Now the most powerfull and largest accelerator in the world called Large Hadron Collider or LHC.  

- **LHC**  
The LHC consists of a 27-kilometre ring of superconducting magnets with a number of accelerating structures to boost the energy of the particles along the way.
