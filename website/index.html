								<h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Machine learning came in order to programming getting more easier that before. Actualy, in machine learning you help computer
							algorithm to improve through data, after that it does not need to being programmed to do so. These data are called Trainig data
							since by using them, you train an algorithm to do something special, it can be a prediction, calssification or make a decision. 
							let me give an example. Assume you want to develop a program so that it determines that the email which you received, 
							is <i>spam</i> or <i>not spam</i>. If you use the old technics, it is required to update it frequently. Because for example, 
								you give the program a keyword like <i>money</i> to say detect it as <i>spam</i>, but if they change it to <code>$</code>, it would be incapable to detect 
							it. But what machine learning do instead?</p>

						<h2>Black holes</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Mysterious objects in universe</p>
				<p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation 
					such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform 
					spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous 
					effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally
					detectable features. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover,
					quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum 
					as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
                                        Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John 
					Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.Thefirst modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole
					was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was
					first published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until
					the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known as such was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.
                                        Black holes of stellar mass form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by 
					absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.
                                        The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic 
					radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by 
					friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive
					black hole can be shred into streamers that shine very brightly before being "swallowed." If there are other stars
					orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can
					be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar
					black hole candidates in binary systems, and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the
					Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses. </p>
