> The mathematician plays a game in which he himself invents the rules while the physicist plays a game in which the rules are provided by nature, but as time 
goes on it becomes increasingly evident that the rules which the mathematician finds interesting are the same as those which nature has chosen

### <font color='blue'>ABOUT ME</font> 
My name is Mohammadreza Ebrahimi, I was born in April 1995, and now I'm 26. Master student of **Particle physics and quantum field theory** at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir) in Isfahan, Iran, under supervision of [Prof. Behrouz Mirza](https://mirza.iut.ac.ir/). I am the **1st** ranked student amonge graduating class with GPA of 3.72/4.00. My thesis consists of two main part; black holes and cosmology. In the first part, I investigated black holes thermodynamic behavior and geometry, in the second one, I have focused on anisotropic cosmology. I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Molecular Physics from [Semnan university](http://english.semnan.ac.ir/), Semnan, Iran, in 2018.

##### <font color='darkblue'>BRIEF EXPLANATION ON RESEARCHES</font> 
Unlike my major title, my research field scale is as large as universe scale. I am working on black hole, their thermodynamic behavior and cosmology. If we  consider the thermodynamic variables as the space-time coordinates, it would be called _thermodynamic geometry_. My research is focused on thermodynamic geometry of black holes. It goes without saying I also have experience in cosmology, most of theoretical cosmologist are working on [standard model of cosmology](https://www.intechopen.com/books/redefining-standard-model-cosmology/introductory-chapter-standard-model-of-cosmology) where we assume that universe behaves just like [Friedmann-Roberston-Walker (FRW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker_metric) metric, but I consider that the universe does not follow the FRW metric that requires the univers to be homogeniouse and isotropy, therefore there would be another metric representation so-called <font color='darkblue'>Bianchi type I</font> universe. In addition, I am interested in machine larning and generally, programming. You can see my portfolios in my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mohammadreza-ebrahimi). Mixture of machine learning and physics could be so delicious, I recommend you taste it.
