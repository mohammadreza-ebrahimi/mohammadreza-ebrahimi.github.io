> The mathematician plays a game in which he himself invents the rules while the physicist plays a game in which the rules are provided by nature, but as time 
goes on it becomes increasingly evident that the rules which the mathematician finds interesting are the same as those which nature has chosen

### <font color='darkblue'>ABOUT ME</font> 
My name is Mohammadreza Ebrahimi Khuzani, and I was born in April 1995. I am currently 26 years old. **Particle physics and quantum field theory** master's student at the [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir) in Isfahan, Iran, supervised by [Prof. Behrouz Mirza](https://mirza.iut.ac.ir/). With a GPA of 3.72/4.00, I am the **first** ranked student in my graduating class. My thesis is divided into two sections: black holes and cosmology. In the first section, I looked at the thermodynamic behavior and geometry of black holes. In the second section, I concentrated on anisotropic cosmology. During my thesis, I tried to develop my programming language in python and C++, since these programming languages are being promoted swiftly. Python and Artificial Intelligence are applied in almost every science, e.g. Biology, Physics, Economy, Politics, Biophysics, etc.

##### <font color='darkblue'>BRIEF EXPLANATION ON RESEARCHES</font> 
My current field of expertise is focused on a material design by applying machine intelligence. My previous research field scale is as large as the cosmos scale, in contrast to my major title. I study black holes, their thermodynamic behavior, and cosmology. We'd like to examine a variety of thermodynamic processes inside black holes, which are now regarded thermodynamic systems following Stephen Hawking's discovery that the black hole functions as a thermodynamic system and defines Entropy in relation to its horizon area. In the study of thermodynamics, for example, a phase transition happens when a material changes its phase, such as from liquid to gas. This effect can also be observed in black holes. The term _thermodynamic geometry_ refers to the use of thermodynamic variables as space-time coordinates. Thermodynamic geometry of black holes is the focus of my research. It goes without saying that I have cosmological experience; most theoretical cosmologists work on the [standard model of cosmology](https://www.intechopen.com/books/redefining-standard-model-cosmology/introductory-chapter-standard-model-of-cosmology), in which we assume that the universe behaves similarly to the [Friedmann-Roberston-Walker (FRW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric) metric, but I believe the universe does not follow the FRW metric, which requires the universe to be homogeneous and isotropy, so another metric representation, known as the Bianchi type I universe, would be needed. In addition, I am fascinated with machine learning and programming in general. My portfolio is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mohammadreza-ebrahimi). I think a combination of machine learning and physics would be delicious, so give it a try.
The Covid-19 epidemic presented me with a fantastic opportunity to gain more experimental particle physics knowledge. On Kaggle, I concentrated on machine learning and physics, analyzing numerous datasets such as the [CMS](https://cms.cern/) and [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) experiments. There are massive tests taking place all over the world to learn more about particles and look for new particles such as axion (the most likely dark matter particle) or Axion Like Particles (ALSPs). In 2012, the [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) experiment discovered the last fundamental particle. You can discover general information about some of the most important experiments being developed to obtain more precise and novel knowledge about particle physics on [this page](exp-hep.md).

### <font color='darkblue'>TEACHING EXPERIENCES</font>
- Lecturer of Git and GitHub workshop.
- Teached xAct, diffgeo and grTensor package for researcher. I define manifold, coordinate, metric, tensors and etc in xAct in order to 
evaluate curvature tensor for the metric. Furthermore, before these steps, we should have equation of motion (field equation) in hand, therfore, it is required to 
varying action and as you, it takes long time to calculate and finally you not sure about the result. So hare I can utilize xAct, instead of complex calculations. I've provided you some sessions of my xAct class in following link. 
  - [IUT-MEET](https://meet.iut.ac.ir/b/beh-y1s-fic-kqy)
- Guided Mathematica and MAPLE for  3 general relativity projects. These are about basic usage of mathematica in general relativity. 
- English language, physics and  mathematics.

This is mainly about degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the surface. Here the bulk is the interior of the universe and the surface is the boundary surface of it. It has been claimed that in for the universe in which it is homogeneous and isotropy, there would be written FRW metric, and subsequently, equivalent between degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk is reached.
