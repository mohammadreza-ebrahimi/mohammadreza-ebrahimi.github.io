### <font color='darkblue'>ABOUT ME</font> 
My name is Mohammadreza Ebrahimi Khuzani, and I was born in April 1995. I graduated with a master's degree in **Particle physics and quantum field** from the [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir), Isfahan, Iran. My supervisor was Prof. Behrouz Mirza. I am the first-ranked student in my graduating class with a GPA of 3.72/4.0. Notwithstanding my primary field of study, particle physics, my thesis focuses on black holes and theoretical cosmology.
In the first part, I explored black holes' thermodynamic behavior and geometry. We have several gravity theories. The most important one is Einstein-Hilbert gravity. 
But, by proposing quantum gravity, other theories on gravity became valuable as well. One of them is pure Lovelock gravity theory which contains higher order of 
curvature tensor, does not contain more than second-order derivative terms, and is free of ghost fields. Hence, this theory is worthy of investigation.
I assumed that we have a black hole in pure Lovelock gravity and tried to find its thermodynamic and critical behavior to compare it with a real thermodynamic system,
e.g., Van der Waals fluid. Our results show that these black holes could exist since it shows the same behavior as that of Van der Waals fluid. In the second section,
I concentrated on anisotropic cosmology. FRW universe is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. I maintained the homogeneity property but considered the universe to be anisotropic.  
I have tried to develop my programming language in python, C/C++, ROOT (CERN), Mathematica Wolfram, Maple and html since 2019. These languages, specially python, are being promoted swiftly. 
Python and Artificial Intelligence are applied in almost every science, e.g., Biology, Physics, Economy, Politics, and Biophysics. I accpeted in the CERN summer school on Machine learning
 in High Energy Physics (MLHEP) and certified as exellence in machine learning and deep learning in addition to getting 4 ECTS of EPFL. Why did I learn python and ML?  
 I am really interested in experimental particle physics. Currently, huge labs and experiments such as CERN and Fermilab assign to particle physics research. Scientists at CERN are
 trying to find and detect new particles and new physics as well as answer the most fundamental questions about the universe and matter. They accelerate particles like proton-proton
 through the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the way of collision, there are four detectors; ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, and LHCb. ATLAS and CMS are used for the same purposes. They include
 particular parts that each of them is used for a special target. Some segments are responsible for tracing the particle's trajectory generated after the collision, and some parts
 analyze data generated by the detector. In an area, the detector ionizes the particle and dozens of other things that are done in less than a second for each collision. For data analysis, a researcher must use tools like ROOT, matplotlib, and ML. Therefore, computer and programming skills play an important role in particle physics and
experimental research. In addition to them, simulation is another exciting part of particle physics where we can analyze and predict some events supposed to be examined in the future.
Tools for collision data and detector simulation are MadGraph5, Sherpa, Delphes, and Geant4.

##### <font color='darkblue'>BRIEF EXPLANATION ON RESEARCHES</font> 
My current field of expertise is focused on application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in electronics and data processing. Additionaly, I am working on simulation and construction of the **Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM)**. At the CMS phase-2 upgrade, main goal is 1% uncertainty at measurement of the **luminosity** (*The number of events that an experiment observes is proportional to a quantity called the luminosity*). For this aim, the FBCM is being designed for online (real time) bounch-by-bounch measurement of the luminosity. FBCM device works indepently from CMS trigger.The ultimate goal of 1% luminosity uncertainty after final calibration requires a negligible statistical error on the calibration constant, the visible cross-section and a deviation from linear response of less than 0.02%/(Hz/ùúáb) up to an average pileup of 200. To meet this goal, the FBCM will utilize 336 silicon-pad sensors with a zero-counting algorithm of the observed hits and it will provide the time of arrival (ToA) and the time over threshold (ToT) of the signal pulses with a few ns resolution. The FBCM will have a semi-digital readout to transfer these data to the back-end, with the front-end chip producing a non-clocked output pulse upon the creation of an ionising signal in the silicon-pad sensor *.  
  
![fbcm](/img/fbcm.png)  
  
Once a hit is received on a silicon-pad sensor, the collected ionization charge produces a short pulse. The signal will be amplified and shaped in the front-end ASIC, then a non-clocked digital output pulse will be produced which is transmitte to the lpGBT (Low Power GigaBit Transceiver, an ASIC widely used for data transmission and control in the Phase-2 projects) via flex cables called e-links. The lpGBT continuously samples the output signal of the front-end channels every 0.78 ns corresponding to the e-link speed (1.28 Gbps).
Then the data will be sent to the back-end by versatile optical link transceivers (VTRx+). At the back-end, an ATCA (Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture) digital processing unit makes histogram of the number of hits per bunch-crossing per sensor and performs labeling the ToA and the ToT after synchronizing to the LHC clock. The timing information will be used for beam-induced background measurement. By counting the number of zero-hit occurrence, known as the zero-counting method, the hit rate and consequently, the luminosity will be calculated. The FBCM ASIC design is planed to be launched in early 2022, and it will make the best use of existing 65 nm electronic building blocks *.

A simple diagram for only one channel shown the readout chain and data transmission. Each
lpGBT supports 7 channels and each port card includes 3 lpGBTs. There will be four port cards per quarter.Thus, each quarter of the FBCM supports 84 channels, leading to 336 silicon-pad sensors for the FBCM.  
My previous research field scale is as large as the cosmos scale, in contrast to
my major title. I study black holes, their thermodynamic behavior, and cosmology. We'd like to examine a variety of thermodynamic processes inside black holes, which are now regarded 
thermodynamic systems following Stephen Hawking's discovery that the black hole functions as a thermodynamic system and defines Entropy in relation to its horizon area. In the study of 
thermodynamics, for example, a phase transition happens when a material changes its phase, such as from liquid to gas. This effect can also be observed in black holes. 
The term _thermodynamic geometry_ refers to the use of thermodynamic variables as space-time coordinates. Thermodynamic geometry of black holes is the focus of my research. 
It goes without saying that I have cosmological experience; most theoretical cosmologists work on the
 [standard model of cosmology](https://www.intechopen.com/books/redefining-standard-model-cosmology/introductory-chapter-standard-model-of-cosmology), in which we assume that
 the universe behaves similarly to the [Friedmann-Roberston-Walker (FRW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric) metric,
 but I believe the universe does not follow the FRW metric, which requires the universe to be homogeneous and isotropy, so another metric representation, known as the Bianchi type I 
universe, would be needed. In addition, I am fascinated with machine learning and programming in general. My portfolio is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mohammadreza-ebrahimi).
 I think a combination of machine learning and physics would be delicious, so give it a try.
The Covid-19 epidemic presented me with a fantastic opportunity to gain more experimental particle physics knowledge.
 On Kaggle, I concentrated on machine learning and physics, analyzing numerous datasets such as the [CMS](https://cms.cern/) and [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) experiments. 
There are massive tests taking place all over the world to learn more about particles and look for new particles such as axion (the most likely dark matter particle) or
 Axion Like Particles (ALSPs). In 2012, the [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) experiment discovered the last fundamental particle. 
You can discover general information about some of the most important experiments being developed to obtain more precise and novel knowledge about particle physics
 on [this page](exp-hep.md).

- Lecturer of Git and GitHub workshop.
- Teached xAct, diffgeo and grTensor package for researcher. I define manifold, coordinate, metric, tensors and etc in xAct in order to 
evaluate curvature tensor for the metric. Furthermore, before these steps, we should have equation of motion (field equation) in hand, therfore, it is required to 
varying action and as you, it takes long time to calculate and finally you not sure about the result. So hare I can utilize xAct, instead of complex calculations. I've provided you some sessions of my xAct class in following link.

This is mainly about degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the surface. Here the bulk is the interior of the universe and the surface is the boundary surface of it. It has been claimed that in for the universe in which it is homogeneous and isotropy, there would be written FRW metric, and subsequently, equivalent between degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk is reached.
