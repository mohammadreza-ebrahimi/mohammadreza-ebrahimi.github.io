> The mathematician plays a game in which he himself invents the rules while the physicist plays a game in which the rules are provided by nature, but as time 
goes on it becomes increasingly evident that the rules which the mathematician finds interesting are the same as those which nature has chosen

### _ABOUT ME_  
Hi, I'm Mohammadreza, I was born in 1995, April and now I'm 26. Master student of physics at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir) in [Isfahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran), under supervision of [Prof. Behrouz Mirza](https://mirza.iut.ac.ir/). I recieved my Bachelor's degree in **Molecular Physics** from [Semnan university](http://english.semnan.ac.ir/), [Semnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semnan), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran) in 2018. More precisely, my field of study is related to **Particle physics and quantum field theory**.

### _RESEARCH INTERESTS_  
Unlike my major title, my research field scale is as large as universe scale. I am working on black hole, their thermodynamic behavior and cosmology. If we consider the thermodynamic variables as the space-time coordinates, it would be called _thermodynamic geometry_. My research is focused on thermodynamic geometry of black holes. It goes without saying I also have experience in cosmology, most of theoretical cosmologist are working on [standard model of cosmology](https://www.intechopen.com/books/redefining-standard-model-cosmology/introductory-chapter-standard-model-of-cosmology) where we assume that universe behaves just like [**Friedmann-Roberston-Walker (FRW)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker_metric) metric, but I consider that the universe does not follow the **FRW** metric that requires the univers to be **homogeniouse** and **isotropy**, therefore there would be another metric representation so-called **Bianchi type I** universe. In addition, I am interested in machine larning and generally, programming. Mixture of machine learning and physics could be so delicious, I recommend you taste it.
