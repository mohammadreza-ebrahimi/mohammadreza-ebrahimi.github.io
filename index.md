> The mathematician plays a game in which he himself invents the rules while the physicist plays a game in which the rules are provided by nature, but as time 
goes on it becomes increasingly evident that the rules which the mathematician finds interesting are the same as those which nature has chosen

### <font color='darkblue'>ABOUT ME</font> 
My name is Mohammadreza Ebrahimi Khuzani, I was born in April 1995, and now I'm 26. Master student of **Particle physics and quantum field theory** at the [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir) in Isfahan, Iran, under the supervision of [Prof. Behrouz Mirza](https://mirza.iut.ac.ir/). I am the **1st** ranked student among graduating class with GPA of 3.72/4.00. My thesis consists of two main parts; black holes and cosmology. In the first part, I investigated black holes thermodynamic behavior and geometry, as the seconf part, I've focused on anisotropic cosmology. Furthermore, I have got a "Certification of Excellence" from EPFL in the field of Machine learning in high energy physics.

##### <font color='darkblue'>BRIEF EXPLANATION ON RESEARCHES</font> 
Unlike my major title, my research field scale is as large as the universe scale. I am working on the black hole, its thermodynamic behavior, and cosmology. There are various thermodynamics processes that we would like to investigate inside black holes since those are considered as a thermodynamic system after Stephen Hawking's discovery which says the black hole acts as a thermodynamic system and defined Entropy concerning its horizon area. For instance, in the study of thermodynamic, we have a phase transition, which occurs when the substance changes its phase, e.g., liquid to gas. We have this behavior in black holes as well. If we  consider the thermodynamic variables as the space-time coordinates, it would be called _thermodynamic geometry_. My research is focused on the thermodynamic geometry of black holes. It goes without saying I also have experience in cosmology, most of theoretical cosmologist are working on [standard model of cosmology](https://www.intechopen.com/books/redefining-standard-model-cosmology/introductory-chapter-standard-model-of-cosmology) where we assume that universe behaves just like [Friedmann-Roberston-Walker (FRW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker_metric) metric, but I consider that the universe does not follow the FRW metric that requires the univers to be homogeniouse and isotropy, therefore there would be another metric representation so-called <font color='darkblue'>Bianchi type I</font> universe. In addition, I am interested in machine learning and generally, programming. You can see my portfolio at [GitHub page](https://github.com/mohammadreza-ebrahimi). A mixture of machine learning and physics could be so delicious, I recommend you taste it.  
Covid-19 pandemic provided me with an excellent opportunity to get more experience in experimental particle physics. I focused on machine learning and physics and have tried to analyze several datasets like CERN collision and [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) experiment on Kaggle. There are huge experiments around the world in order to find out more about particles, searching for new particles like axion (the most probable dark matter particle). The last fundamental particle was detected in 2012 at [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) experiment. In [this page](exp-hep.md), you can find general information about some of the most important experiments are being developed to get more precise and new information about particle physics.

### <font color='darkblue'>TEACHING EXPERIENCES</font>
- Lecturer of Git and GitHub workshop.
- Teached xAct, diffgeo and grTensor package for researcher. I define manifold, coordinate, metric, tensors and etc in xAct in order to 
evaluate curvature tensor for the metric. Furthermore, before these steps, we should have equation of motion (field equation) in hand, therfore, it is required to 
varying action and as you, it takes long time to calculate and finally you not sure about the result. So hare I can utilize xAct, instead of complex calculations. I've provided you some sessions of my xAct class in following link. 
  - [IUT-MEET](https://meet.iut.ac.ir/b/beh-y1s-fic-kqy)
- Guided Mathematica and MAPLE for  3 general relativity projects. These are about basic usage of mathematica in general relativity. 
- English language, physics and  mathematics. 

### <font color='darkblue'>ACADEMIC PROJECTS</font>
- Mohammadreza Ebrahimi Khuzani, Prof. Behrouz Mirza, Isfahan University of Technology, Winter 2019.  Holographic Equipartition and Friedman Equations.  
This is mainly about degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the surface. Here the bulk is the interior of the universe and the surface is the boundary surface of it. It has been claimed that in for the universe in which it is homogeneous and isotropy, there would be written FRW metric, and subsequently, equivalent between degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk is reached.
